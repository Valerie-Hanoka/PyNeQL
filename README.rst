PyNeQL: a module for searching Named Entity on SPARQL endpoints
===========================================================

*In development*

Linked Data is the global database of the World Wide Web.
One can query those linked databases by sending SPARQL queries to different endpoints.

SPARQL vocabularies are huge and it is sometimes tedious to find how to ask for simple
things as Named Entities.

This module aims to provide a very simple way to query a named entity by its name, and retrieve
a maximum of information from different SPARQL endpoints.
